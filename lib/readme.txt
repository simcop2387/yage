Yage can be compiled several times faster if it doesn't also have to compile derelict.
The build script (proj/buildme.d) is configured by default to look here for derelict lib files.
This folder has dmd-compiled derelict lib files for windows and x86 linux.

Can these files be used with DMD on Linux?
