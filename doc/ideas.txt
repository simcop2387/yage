Add a max lights setting per material

Add a setting for min or max mipmap level per texture at the material level

Add boolean set operations to the Resource manager, to load all resources from a new level and free only those that aren't part of that set.

Break apart Device.init() into different subsystems, and reduce dependance on dll's to only when they're actually used.

A sensor node that checks for certain events (brightness, velocity, distance, etc.) and calls callback functions when
certain events occur.  (any node can do this in its update function).

Use axis sorting to tell what lights affect what nodes (instead of n*m distance check).  But most lights have large radius?

Use dx cross dy to calculate normals for parametric graphnodes.

Create typed exceptions.

Make logging consistent and typed.
