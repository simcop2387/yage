This is a somewhat deprecated list of bugs that I don't yet know the solution for.  If
something just hasn't been implemented or fixed yet and the fix is
known, it shouldn't appear on this list.


[Unresolved]

When the window is sized below about 1/4th the size of it's starting size,
SDL's grab input mode freezes the application until the mouse is released

How can I get the state of mouse buttons 6+ with SDL?

How can I use the scroll wheel (mouse buttons 4-5)?

How do I enable key repeating?  SDL_EnableKeyRepeat doesn't seem to work.

Quaternion bug when rotating around exactly 360 degrees on a single axis?
fixed?

There is jumpiness in the rendering.  Every 10th or so frame takes almost exactly twice as long to render
than others, when rendering the same thing.  Especially noticable when rendering lots of models
The issue is in my timing code.  Lots of time spent in opengl functions makes
std.perf and sdl_getticks inaccurate.  Need to test on linux

Camera view of ship shakes wildly when near z axis.
