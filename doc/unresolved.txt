This is a list of bugs that I don't yet know the solution for.  If
something just hasn't been implemented or fixed yet and the fix is
known, it shouldn't appear on this list.


[Unresolved]

When the window is sized below about 1/4th the size of it's starting size,
SDL's grab input mode freezes the application until the mouse is released
    
It looks like an SDL_VIDEORESIZE event isn't sent when the window is
maximized or minimized, but only when the borders are resized.\
This causes viewport sizing problems.
	
How can I get the state of mouse buttons 6+ with SDL?

How can I use the scroll wheel (mouse buttons 4-5)?

How do I enable key repeating?  SDL_EnableKeyRepeat doesn't seem to work.

Quaternion bug when rotating around exactly 360 degrees on a single axis?
fixed?

Dmd has trouble compiling incrementally with -O

There is jumpiness in the rendering.  Every 10th or so frame takes almost exactly twice as long to render
than others, when rendering the same thing.  Especially noticable when rendering lots of models
The issue is in my timing code.  Lots of time spent in opengl functions makes
std.perf and sdl_getticks inaccurate.  Need to test on linux

The end of the spring following the ship is way too close half the time.
This is caused by tail.getAbsolutePosition() returning an incorrect result.
The sort in Universe.update() changes the order of update between the spring head and tail
if one is updated and the other isn't, positions will be different.
Need to ensure that both have been updated before calling spring.update().
