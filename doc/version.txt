[Yage 0.1.2]
6-17-2006 11:22am
Sound support:
	A Sound resource.
	A SoundNode to create instances of sounds
	Wav and Ogg Vorbis.
	Doppler effects and positional audio using OpenAL
Much improved Vector, Matrix, and Quaternion classes
Added FreeList, a templated class to support allocations and deallocations of
	Matrix, Vector, Quaternion, and Plane using a freelist for better speed.
Nodes now support Velocity internally and a recursive .update() method.
RootNode renamed to Scene

[Yage 0.1.1]
2-23-2006 8:30pm
Added support for an infinite number of lights, where up to the 8 brightest are
	enabled for each node rendered, if it's lit.
Added getBrightness function for lights.
Added support for light quadratic attenuation.
Added support for spotlights and directional lights.
Added a RootNode class.  It is now enforced that this node can and must be
	at the top level of every node heirarchy.  This will allow for per-scene
	variables.
Lights are now managed by the RootNode.
Added rendering support for multiple material layers.
Modified the core library for in-place operations rather than by-copy 
Refactored nodes and resources into their own modules.
Quite a bit more refactoring and several other new methods.

[Yage 0.1.0]
1-27-2006 3:27pm
Added a basic light class.
Added a basic Plane class for planes in 3D space.
Added very fast view-frustum culling (2.5 million nodes culled per second on
	my laptop, without even any tree-based culling).
Added setScale function for ModelNodes.
Added getRadius for all nodes; used in culling.
Added material attribute (diffuse, specularity, etc.) support.
Refactored quite a bit, mostly for consistency in function names.
Added a getAbsolute function for all nodes, to return the absolute
	position and rotation.
Added support for skyboxes.

[Yage 0.0.9]
1-5-2006 1:25pm
Started tinkering with vertex shaders for cool lighting effects.
Added a resource manager to pool identical resources together and to
	prevent the same model, material, texture, or shader from being loaded twice.
Separated a new Shader class out of the Material class.
Input upport for grabbing the mouse cursor.

[Yage 0.0.8]
12-30-2005 5:28pm
Better linux support (resizing window fixed, among other things).
Support for mouse input and text stream input.

[Yage 0.0.7]
12-27-2005
Basic support for loading / rendering milkshape3d models--more features to come.
Major additions to vecmatx (renamed to math3d).  Added matrix class and more
	functions to Vec3 and Quatrn.
Moved code for timing, 3d math, and other misc functions into a "core" module.
Added support for logging the results of shader compilation and linking.

[Yage 0.0.6]
12-17-2005 8:30pm
Removed dependance on (rather useless) Texture and Scene manager classes.
Added a new Resource Manager to keep track of resources that have been loaded.
Added a basic log class to track engine status.
Switched to exceptions for error handling.
Added support for loading and compiling shaders from the material class.
Various tweaks in the XML loading code of the materials class to support more
	attributes and be more xml compliant.

[Yage 0.0.5]
12-15-2005 9:56pm
Completed a preliminary trial of pixel shaders.
A few other minor refactoring changes.

[Yage 0.0.4]
11-25-2005 6:34pm
Added support for cameras that render to texture.
Changed Device so it now has a render function that renders a texture.
Cool things like on-the-fly, non-quantitized resolution changing are now 
	possible.  You could scale down the resolution gradually and dynamically to
	increase framerates in more detailed areas.

[Yage 0.0.3]
11-14-2005 7:37pm
Added a very nice texture manager with support for loading and unloading images,
	resizing images and the hardware requires, and setting filtering and
	texture mipmapping options.
Added an abstract manager class to manage textures, scenes, etc.
Added a SceneManager and a Scene class.
Added an abstract Node class and a BoxNode class for current testing purposes.
Added support for node heirarchies.
Started a primitive vector class, Vec3

[Yage 0.0.1]
10-31-2005 12:19am
Added very primitive texture loading support in texture.d

[Yage 0.0.0]
10-29-2005 7:26pm
Created buildme.bat and runme.bat
Created yage.d and device.d
This is a basic test of SDL/OpenGL working in D.
