Ensure that dmc is setup on your system and there is a path variable
to dmc's bin folder.
Create header files with function prototypes of extern "C"
Compile the project but don't link... c:\>dmc -c main.cpp
The dmc compiler must be used because it outputs in omf binary format.
Run lib.exe 
type a name for your library file
type +main.obj // or whatever your object files are
Yes, create a new library.
Ignore the .lst file.
Type a name for your library file (again)
now you can copy your lib file to the appropriate directory and run
c:\>dmd.exe main.d library.lib
and everything should link with no error messages
You will receive an error message if you use another c++ compiler than dmc.
